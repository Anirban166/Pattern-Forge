A simple Flask-based webapp for generating and visualizing 3D parametric garment patterns that are formed using lines and BÃ©zier curves. I created this mini-project as a technical case study for Six Atomic.

To try it out locally in your browser, run `python3 app.py` in your terminal after cloning and navigation. Currently, it includes two pre-defined shirt-oriented patterns to play around with:

<img src = "static/Shirt.png"  alt = "Shirt Pattern"  width = "100%" height = "auto">
<img src = "static/Collar.png" alt = "Collar Pattern" width = "100%" height = "auto">
